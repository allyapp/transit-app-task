##Mobile App Technical Assignment

**Objective**

To build a simplified version of a transit app.

There is no need to implement routing logic or to connect to a real backend service. The available routes should be extracted from the static JSON file in this repo

**What are we looking for?**

We would like you to build a UI that includes:

1. A comprehensive overview of all the routes in a single page.

2. Navigation to a detailed view of a single route, where more information is made available.


The task has been deliberately left open to give you an opportunity to demonstrate...

­- Best practices you adhere to.

­- Common libraries you might use.

­- UX considerations.

­- Platform specific patterns (MVP, MVVM,DI... ).

- Unit and/or integration tests.

Feel free to take inspiration from the current Door2Door apps or create your own UI.

**What to submit?**

Please submit your solutions in a form of publicly accessible git repository. We will clone it and evaluate your work so you should make sure the project builds right after cloning.

**Advice**

­Write the code in small increments, start with essential functionality and improve upon it. The goal is not to build as many features as possible, but rather to show good coding practices. However feel free to write what and how you would build given more time. 
­Good development practices should be observed. The code should be written as if it was going to be used in production and read by other developers 
­Polyline are in the form of [googles encoded polyline algorithm format] (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm?hl=en)

**Final Considerations**

Take your time, the quality is more important than the speed. And let us know if you are not able to send a solution in the next days.
